## Installation & Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher

### Running the Game

#### 1. Start the Server

You have two options for starting the server:

**Option A: With Save File Menu (Recommended)**

```bash
python server_launcher.py
```

This will show a menu where you can:
- Load an existing save file
- Start a new world
- View save file details (player count, save date, etc.)

**Option B: Quick Start Without Menu**

```bash
python game_server.py
```

This starts a new world without the save file selection menu.

The server will start on `0.0.0.0:5555` by default, accepting connections from any IP address.

**Note:** If you want to host for friends over the internet, you'll need to:
- Forward port 5555 on your router
- Share your public IP address with players
- Or use a service like ngrok to expose your local server

#### 2. Connect Clients

Players can connect using the client:

```bash
python game_client.py
```

When prompted:
- **For local testing:** Use `localhost` as the server IP
- **For LAN play:** Use the server's local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
- **For internet play:** Use the server's public IP or ngrok URL
- **Port:** Use `5555` (default) or whatever port you configured

#### 3. Create Your Character

When you connect, you'll be prompted to enter a username. This will be your character name in the game!

## Save System

### How Saves Work

The game features an automatic save system that preserves player progress:

- **Save Files** - All saves are stored in the `saves/` directory as `.tms` files (Terminal Multiplayer Save)
- **Format** - Save files use JSON format, making them human-readable and easy to edit
- **Auto-Save** - Game automatically saves every 5 minutes
- **Graceful Shutdown** - Pressing `Ctrl+C` saves the game before shutting down

### Save File Contents

Each `.tms` file contains:
- All player data (stats, inventory, location, etc.)
- Timestamp of when it was saved
- Server configuration

Example save file structure:
```json
{
  "saved_at": "2025-10-02T14:30:45",
  "players": {
    "Hero": {
      "health": 120,
      "level": 5,
      "location": "dark_forest",
      ...
    }
  },
  "server_info": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 5555
  }
}
```

### Managing Save Files

- **View Saves** - Use `server_launcher.py` to see all available saves
- **Load Save** - Select from the menu when starting the server
- **Edit Saves** - Save files are JSON, so you can edit them manually if needed
- **Backup** - Simply copy `.tms` files from the `saves/` directory

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Server** (`game_server.py`) - Handles all game logic and manages player connections
- **Client** (`game_client.py`) - Provides the terminal interface for players
- **Game Data** (`game_data.py`) - Contains all game content (locations, enemies, items)
- **Server Launcher** (`server_launcher.py`) - Save file selection menu

### Networking
- Uses TCP sockets for reliable communication
- Multi-threaded server handles multiple concurrent connections
- Each player connection runs in its own thread

### Data Persistence
- Player data is saved to `.tms` files in JSON format
- Automatic periodic saves every 5 minutes
- Graceful shutdown saves on Ctrl+C
- Save files persist across server restarts

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Add more locations, enemies, and items
- Implement a quest system
- Add player-vs-player combat
- Create character classes (warrior, mage, rogue)
- Add equipment slots (armor, accessories)
- Implement a party/group system
- Add rare item drops
- Create boss battles requiring multiple players
- Add a trade system between players

## Troubleshooting

**Can't connect to server?**
- Make sure the server is running first
- Check that you're using the correct IP address and port
- For internet play, ensure port forwarding is configured correctly
- Check firewall settings

**Server crashes?**
- Check that no other program is using port 5555
- Try running with sudo/admin privileges if needed
- Check Python version (3.6+ required)

**Connection lost?**
- Server may have crashed or restarted
- Network connection may be unstable
- Simply reconnect with the client
